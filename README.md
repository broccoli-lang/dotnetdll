# dotnetdll
A Rust library for reading and writing .NET metadata, such as DLL files.

## NOTE: This library is not yet released
The core functionality for `dotnetdll` is complete, as well as its test suite.
I am currently working on documentation and example projects.
However, the API surface may still change while preparing for release.
